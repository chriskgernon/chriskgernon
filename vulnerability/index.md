# Purpose

The goal of this lab was to replicate figure 4, a map of resilience scores in Malawi in 2010, and replicate 80% of figure 5, a map of vulnerability to climate change in Malawi, from Malcomb et al paper titled, "Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa: An operationalized approach in Malawi." Additionally, the purpose of this lab was to be exposed to the issue of reproducibility and transparency in academic work.

 
 # Discussion
Reproducibility is a major issue in academia– particularly in GIS and geography. Academics frequently publish papers (even in major journals) with methods and results that are impossible to reproduce because of a lack of data and or vague descriptions of methodology. 

With the increasing relevance of climate change in people’s lives, measuring vulnerability has become a top priority for organizations like the United Nations (Hinkel 2010). Additionally, vulnerability assessments have become especially important because legislation and policy decisions regarding combating climate change hinge on the results of these assessments. Reproducibility and replicability for vulnerability models and analysis is particular difficult. First, there is no standard for “measuring” vulnerability in academia (Hinkel 2010). It requires taking several factors thought to impact vulnerability and synthesizing them into one number. Some people argue that it is impossible to measure vulnerability. Second, there is confusion regarding the purpose of assessing vulnerability– something that’s particularly concerning because vulnerability assessments are carried out for different purposes (Hinkle 2010). 


# Malcomb et al.'s Methodology

The goal of Malcomb et al.'s paper was to use a new approach to vulnerability modeling so that Malawain policy-makers could determine the geographic areas most susceptibal to hazards, climatic change and variability, and degraded livelihood security. In order to determine the vulnerabilities associated with Malawian people, they peformed seventy interviews with government, non- government and development officials along with focus group interviews in eleven villages. They write, "These multi-level, semi-structured in- terviews with experts and stakeholders were essential in identifying Malawi’s distinct socio-ecological issues that included physical exposure to recurring floods and droughts, lack of access to markets, food, water, health care and labor, reduced assets of land, livestock and income and increased livelihood sensitivity to market exposure and agricultural practices" (Malcomb et al. 2015).


we looked temporally across Malawi’s most recent decade of natural disasters to develop and apply a new approach to vulnerability modeling; one that can be used by Malawian policy-makers to determine geographic areas most sus- ceptible to hazards, climatic change and variability, and degraded livelihood security.Fieldwork included over seventy interviews with government, non- government and development officials along with focus group in- terviews in eleven villages. These multi-level, semi-structured in- terviews with experts and stakeholders were essential in identifying Malawi’s distinct socio-ecological issues that included physical exposure to recurring floods and droughts, lack of access to markets, food, water, health care and labor, reduced assets of land, livestock and income and increased livelihood sensitivity to market exposure and agricultural practices. To model household-level dy- namics, socioeconomic data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conduct by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) from 2004 and 2010 were incorporated. This resource provides researchers with excellent temporal and spatial coverage. In addition, livelihood data specific to Malawi was acquired through the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) and physical exposure risk data from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The paper details the strategy used to develop and apply a new approach to vulnerability analysis to determine areas most susceptible to this combination of social and environ- mental factors in Malawi.

This research extensively used interviews with experts and villagers in Malawi to identify Malawi’s contextual issues. 

1) assets of land, livestock and income, 2) access to markets, food, water, health care and labor, 3) livelihood sensitivity based market expo- sure, crop productivity and use of natural resources for coping with disasters and 4) physical exposure to recurring floods and droughts.

Between May and July 2003, the MVAC conducted a livelihood rezoning exercise and a Household Economy Approach (HEA) baseline survey in eleven livelihood zones in Malawi. The director of the MVAC stated that the HEA is based on exchange entitlements and economic theories of risk. Based on the results of this countrywide survey, livelihood zones were created where households share similar options for obtaining food and income. Wealth groups were established by dividing the population into categories of Poor, Middle and Better-Off in a process that was unique to each livelihood zone and based on experts of the assessment committee and district executives. 65% of Malawi’s population was considered poor by the MVAC in 2005. Using this data, four indicators were developed to evaluate the sensitivity of Malawi’s livelihoods. 1) The percent of food that poor households receive independently from their own farm. This variable is an indication of the sustainability of livelihoods in various zones. 2) The percentage of income that poor households receive from wage labor. Interviews indicate that many households balance their deficits in food production using local wage labor. 3) The percent- age of labor income that is susceptible to market shocks (i.e. to- bacco, sugar, tea and coffee). 4) Ecological destruction associated with livelihood coping strategies during time of crisis in each zone.

This analysis used QGIS Desktop 3.8.1 with GRASS 7.6.1 and WGS 84 as the coordinate reference system. I used an extent of 32.66,-17.125: 35.875,-9.375. I used a 2.5 minute resolution (0.04166666 decimal degrees) to make my figure 4. 


## Adaptive Capacity: Summarizing DHS Surveys by Traditional Authroity (TA)

Because the metadata for the DHS survey data is so extensive, our class extracted the variables in Malcolm et al.'s assets and access analysis. We all got assigned a variable and wrote the SQL to reclassify the data into quantiles. Many of us had to make judgement calls because ambiguity in the data. For example, it was unclear whether 1 or 5 were the high or low value.

Professor Holler proofread the code and gave us aggregated TA data. Professor Holler was the only one of us allowed to look at the DHS data directly because he was the only one who filled out the necessary forms to receive access to it.

The final product this lab should be documentation of the data sources, the methodology (including those
parts you completed yourself, and those parts we completed as a class), and your results. Include as much
as you can discern about who produced the data, what time period the data represents, the coordinate
reference system, extent, spatial resolution, and any information about uncertainty or sampling methods.
It should also include, to the best of your knowledge, an assessment of the reproducibility of this work with
reference to our readings. In this regard, I suggest reviewing Malcomb et al from top to bottom.


1) Did your maps appear to give the same results as Malcomb et al? Why or why not?
2) Do you consider the research paper to be reproducible? In what ways did it succeed or not succeed in this
regard? Work through the paper from beginning to end, following Tate's outline of approaches to
geographic vulnerability analysis.
3) Do you think Malcomb et al adequately considered error and uncertainty in their paper? Support your
position with specific examples.
4) Based on this experience and recent readings, what are some specific strategies you can use in order to
become a better geographer doing research with GIS?
5) In order to be replicable, research should be rigorous enough in terms of its conceptualization (terms,
definitions and relationships), data, and methodology, to produce similar findings in new contexts (e.g.
different countries or time periods) with respect to the level of uncertainty inherent in the system of study.
Are there problems of uncertainty inherent in vulnerability "systems of study" that would make it difficult to
find similar results applying the same concepts and methods to new cases?
