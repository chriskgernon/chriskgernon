Reproducibility is a major issue in academia– particularly in GIS and geography. Academics frequently publish papers (even in major journals) with methods and results that are impossible to reproduce because of a lack of data and or vague descriptions of methodology. 

With the increasing relevance of climate change in people’s lives, measuring vulnerability has become a top priority for organizations like the United Nations (Hinkel 2010). Additionally, vulnerability assessments have become especially important because legislation and policy decisions regarding combating climate change hinge on the results of these assessments. Reproducibility and replicability for vulnerability models and analysis is particular difficult. First, there is no standard for “measuring” vulnerability in academia (Hinkel 2010). It requires taking several factors thought to impact vulnerability and synthesizing them into one number. Some people argue that it is impossible to measure vulnerability. Second, there is confusion regarding the purpose of assessing vulnerability– something that’s particularly concerning because vulnerability assessments are carried out for different purposes (Hinkle 2010).
