Reproducibility is a major issue in academia– particularly in GIS and geography. Academics frequently publish papers (even in major journals) with methods and results that are impossible to reproduce because of a lack of data and or vague descriptions of methodology. 

With the increasing relevance of climate change in people’s lives, measuring vulnerability has become a top priority for organizations like the United Nations (Hinkel 2010). Additionally, vulnerability assessments have become especially important because legislation and policy decisions regarding combating climate change hinge on the results of these assessments. Reproducibility and replicability for vulnerability models and analysis is particular difficult. First, there is no standard for “measuring” vulnerability in academia (Hinkel 2010). It requires taking several factors thought to impact vulnerability and synthesizing them into one number. Some people argue that it is impossible to measure vulnerability. Second, there is confusion regarding the purpose of assessing vulnerability– something that’s particularly concerning because vulnerability assessments are carried out for different purposes (Hinkle 2010). 

we looked temporally across Malawi’s most recent decade of natural disasters to develop and apply a new approach to vulnerability modeling; one that can be used by Malawian policy-makers to determine geographic areas most sus- ceptible to hazards, climatic change and variability, and degraded livelihood security.Fieldwork included over seventy interviews with government, non- government and development officials along with focus group in- terviews in eleven villages. These multi-level, semi-structured in- terviews with experts and stakeholders were essential in identifying Malawi’s distinct socio-ecological issues that included physical exposure to recurring floods and droughts, lack of access to markets, food, water, health care and labor, reduced assets of land, livestock and income and increased livelihood sensitivity to market exposure and agricultural practices. To model household-level dy- namics, socioeconomic data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conduct by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) from 2004 and 2010 were incorporated. This resource provides researchers with excellent temporal and spatial coverage. In addition, livelihood data specific to Malawi was acquired through the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) and physical exposure risk data from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The paper details the strategy used to develop and apply a new approach to vulnerability analysis to determine areas most susceptible to this combination of social and environ- mental factors in Malawi.

This research extensively used interviews with experts and villagers in Malawi to identify Malawi’s contextual issues. 

1) assets of land, livestock and income, 2) access to markets, food, water, health care and labor, 3) livelihood sensitivity based market expo- sure, crop productivity and use of natural resources for coping with disasters and 4) physical exposure to recurring floods and droughts.

Between May and July 2003, the MVAC conducted a livelihood rezoning exercise and a Household Economy Approach (HEA) baseline survey in eleven livelihood zones in Malawi. The director of the MVAC stated that the HEA is based on exchange entitlements and economic theories of risk. Based on the results of this countrywide survey, livelihood zones were created where households share similar options for obtaining food and income. Wealth groups were established by dividing the population into categories of Poor, Middle and Better-Off in a process that was unique to each livelihood zone and based on experts of the assessment committee and district executives. 65% of Malawi’s population was considered poor by the MVAC in 2005. Using this data, four indicators were developed to evaluate the sensitivity of Malawi’s livelihoods. 1) The percent of food that poor households receive independently from their own farm. This variable is an indication of the sustainability of livelihoods in various zones. 2) The percentage of income that poor households receive from wage labor. Interviews indicate that many households balance their deficits in food production using local wage labor. 3) The percent- age of labor income that is susceptible to market shocks (i.e. to- bacco, sugar, tea and coffee). 4) Ecological destruction associated with livelihood coping strategies during time of crisis in each zone.
