## My First QGIS Model
In the first lab, we created a model to calculate direction and distrance from a point.

Here are two graphs I made using the entire state of Kansas. I used an arbitrary point in the Northeast corner of the state as the City Center and all the census tracts as the Input Features. 

This [graph](dir_plot.html) shows how the direction impacts the median rent based on Census Tracts in Kansas.

This [graph](dist_plot.html) shows how the distance from the point impacts the median rent based on Census Tracts in Kansas. The jump in Median Rent around 50k is the Kansas City Metropolitan area and the jump around 250k is the Wichita Metropolitan area.
