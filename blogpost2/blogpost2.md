Purpose: This study was a deductive study, and the purpose of it was to offer a framework for social media analytics and show that it can be used as a tool to 
understand a customers experience at a destination. 

Source:  Twitter Archiving Google Sheet (TAGS) Version 6.0 was used to collect the tweets.
No specific words were used in the quer parameters. The center of the Disneyland (latitude: 33.812560, longitude: âˆ’117.918985)
was chosen as the center, and all tweets within a 0.23 mile radius were collected. Tweets were collected from November
16 2014 to August 22 2015. 120,241 tweets were gathered. 

The study is not reprodubible becuase you cannot get the same data that the study collected; however,
the study is replicable. You could apply the same methods and produce similar results with new tweets. Or, you could 
apply the study's methods to a completely different location with tourists/consumers and get similar results.

Libraries required to replicate study: stringi, tidyverse, stringr, plyr, sentistrength(?)
