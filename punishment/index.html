<h1>Punishment Project</h1>

<h2> Puropse of Website:</h2>

<p>Recently, Oregon passed Measure 110, a ballot initiative that makes possessing heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and other drugs for personal use no longer a criminal offense, and it passed with more than 58% of the vote. Measure 110 is the most progessive drug reform bill to pass in any state, dealing a monumental blow to the war on drugs in the United States. As the first state to decriminalize marijuana in 1973, the second state to legalize majijuana for medical purposes, the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now, the first state to decriminalize drugs for personal use, Oregon has been on the cutting edge of drug policy reform. While most other states followed the federal government&#39;s punitive policy turn towards drugs in the 70s, Oregon did not follow suit. In fact, instead of taking a punitive turn, Oregon decriminalized cannabis and invested in rehabilitation programs for drug users. This begs the questions, what makes Oregon different from the rest of the country? Why made the state take a rehabilitative approach to punishment when the national trend was to declare a war on drugs? This website hopes to offer answers to some of these questions.
</p>

<h2>Methods:</h2>

<p>This project will analyze the discourse in 34 different newspaper articles from 1967-2020 to determine how drugs and punishment are talked about in Oregonian newspapers over time. The discourse analysis will use a Durkheimian framework in order to understand how the social facts around drugs change throughout Oregon&#39;s history. In his, The Rules of Sociological Method, Durkheim defines social facts as:</p>

<blockquote>"A social fact is any way of acting, whether fixed or not, capable of exerting over the individual an external constraint; or: which is general over the whole of a given society whilst having an existence of its own, independent of its individual manifestations."</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

 <blockquote>"[They] consist of manners of acting, thinking and feeling external to the individual, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him." </blockquote>

<p>For Durkheim, a society is more than just a collection of individuals that exist in close proximity to each other. Society is a collection of ideas, beliefs, and sentiments that exist through individuals. While individuals have their own collection of ideas, beliefs, and sentiments, when individuals interact together, an entirely new collection of ideas, beliefs and sentiments is created. Meaning, for Durkheim, society is greater than the sum of its parts. </p>

<p>Thus, social facts are determined not by any single individual, but they emerge out of a collective of individuals or society as a whole. They are designed to encompass the social environment which constrains individual behaviour. In this way, society imposes itself onto the individual from the outside through the establishment of social norms and values when conformity is either expected or encouraged. Throughout my analysis, I extrapolate certain social facts of the time based on the logic and givens implicitly ungirding the information, so while it is an individual who is asserting something about drugs and or crime and punishment, it is based on a whole collection of societal beliefs.</p>


<p>Social facts include a society&#39;s legal code, religious beliefs, concept of beauty, monetary system, ways of dressing, or its language. As such, the state is an institution capable of heavily influencing a society&#39;s social facts, particularly when it comes to crime and punishment. However, the opinion section of newspapers and social media give individuals the power to also influence social facts.</p>

<p>Durkheim argues that social facts should be treated as real objects that are determined by their ability to coerce behaviour.  According to the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, a peer-reviewed academic resource,“What Durkheim means by this is that social facts have an existence independent of the knowing subject and that they impose themselves on the observer. Social facts can be recognized by the sign that they resist the action of individual will upon them.” Durkheim also argues that social facts can only be understood in relation to other social facts and how they integrate and regulate individuals within a group. </p>



<p>Thus, an investigation into the social facts of drugs and punishment established by Oregon&#39;s newspapers aim to answer questions such as: what is a drug? Why are they bad? Why should people who use drugs be punished? How should societies punish people who use drugs?</p>






<h2>
    Findings:
</h2>

<p>
    According to an article posted in the <i>Albany Democrat Herald</i> on April 19, 1967, the Oregon House of Representatives voted down a proposal to restrict invitations that would go to campus speakers. The sponsors of the bill hoped to exclude speakers who would advocate for either the overthrow of the government or the illegal use of drugs. Such a move affirms the social fact that illegal drug use is at least socially acceptable to talk about. Moreover, according to articles analyzed in the late 60s, there were four influential institutions that more or less advocated for the decriminalization of marijuana: the news, Academia, the United States Food and Drug Administration, and the Health, Education and Welfare Department. According to an article posted on April 28, 1967, there was an editorial posted the previous week that defended the right of students to use drugs. In the same article, the author denounces a college professor who appeared on a T.V. show where he stated he did not think drugs were harmful and that students should not be arrested for using them. The author writes, &quot;We have strict national laws against the sale and use of drugs. If these drugs did not destroy the users health and lead to crime and death, if they are not harmful, then why do we have these laws?&quot; This logic sets up several interesting potential social facts. First, the government passes laws that are rooted in fact and logic and should be followed. Second, anything that destroys health and leads to crime and death should have laws that punish anyone who partakes in that thing. Third, that drugs are a category of substances that are bad for humans and lead to crime and death. 
</p>

<p>Interestingly, that same year, in an article published in <i>The World</i>, an editorialist writes about Dr. James L. Goddard, commissioner of U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and asserts that Goddard claimed that alcohol was more dangerous than marijuana. However, the comissioner quickly backtracked and claimed he said nothing of the sort. This example establishes that it is still widely unacceptable for public officials to deviate from the perspective that alcohol is more harmful than marijuana. Later in the article, the author asserts that drug dealers are the source of the issue and that they are the ones that are guilty of violations that should call for a &quot;ten year penitentiary sentence and the contempt of the community.&quot; Such a perspective again advocates for a punitive consequence for selling marijuana or drugs and blames drug dealers for hurting their community. This shows that the author thinks drugs and marijuana should be dealt with punitively but lets the actual user of the drug off the hook. 

</p>

<p>Two years later, an article posted in <i>The World</i> on December 2, 1969 claims that Senior officials in the Health, Education and Welfare Department are open minded about &quot;pot.&quot; The author supports the idea that once it is proven that marijuana is less harmful than alcohol then it should be legalized. Additionally, they assert that the biggest harm in having marijuana be illegal is that it forces people to interact with drug dealers to acquire the drug. By interacting with drug dealers, it exposes people into &quot;the underworld,&quot; referring to the scary and criminal world people who sell drugs exist in. This perspective establishes that alcohol should be the standard of harm that calls for legalization. Moreover, it implicitly states that the harm of the drug use does not come from the actual drug itself but from the person who sells it. </p>

<p>Then, a year later, an editorial was published that declares that marijuana is here to stay and that it should be legalized because the effort to contain it would be &quot;costly and futile.&quot; Thus, people should &quot;have these euphoria-stimulating potions&quot; without a penalty. 

</p>

<p>Two years later, The World posted its first page out of a four part series on drug use. Each of these parts were full page articles that were intended to scare people away from using drugs. Look at the evidence tab for further information. Interestingly, that same year, an article was posted which contends that the American Medical Association published a report that states that the possession of marijuana for personal use should not be considered a crime, which was in stark contrast to its present policy. </p>
<p>
    
In 1973, an editorial stated that criminal penalties should reflect the harm of the drug being used. &quot;I personally happen to believe that the most serious drug abuse in this society is alcohol. I don’t know that we should treat a drug for which there is no demonstrable harm any differently than alcohol for which there is demonstrable harm.&quot; They thought there should be a distinction between someone that used heroin and someone who used marijuana. This shows a fundamental belief that drug use should be illegal but that &quot;the law should reflect, in its penalties, the reality of the difference.&quot;

</p>

<p>
   That same year a bill that would decriminalize possession of up to 8 ounces of marijuana was defeated in the Oregon house. However, a later bill that decriminalized possession of up to one ounce of marijuana passed. This collection of moves by lawmakers declares that criminality should be determined not by the possession of something but instead should be determined by the amount possessed. The article states, &quot;The overriding issue… is the tragedy of giving young people criminal records, ruining lives in many cases, for doing something that lawmakers and enforcers cannot demonstrate is harmful.&quot;  This contends that not only are drugs not necessarily bad for you but also that criminality should be contingent on harm to oneself or the community.
 
    
</p>

<p>
    
    Two years later, an article published in the same newspaper titled, &quot;No Drug Abuses in Oregon,&quot; alleged that a recent survey found that, &quot;Removing its criminal penalties for small amounts of marijuana has not led to dramatic abuses in the use of the drugs in Oregon.&quot; In fact, it claimed there was a decrease in use. If what this article reported was accurate, this establishes a social fact that the criminality of marijuana does not significantly impact use. 
</p>
<p>
    In may of 1977, an article published the Lane County prosecutor saying, &quot;They [Oregon&apos;s police] readily enforce the law now because the law is fair and it’s not as time consuming.&quot;


</p>

<p>
    12 years later, the sentiment in the Oregon house around marijuana and its criminality changed. Earl Blumanauer, a county commissioner who voted to decriminalize marijuana in 1973 said, &quot;In the last 10 years marijuana has become more powerful, and the sophistication of the growers has increased, so we need tougher laws. Increasing the penalties for possession of marijuana is consistent with the trends in other drug charges.&quot; Another representative said, &quot;We&apos;re doing this because we want people to know Oregon wants to be big, bad meanies about drugs.&quot; The article also covers the opponents of the bill, saying &quot;Roberts also worries about users of small amounts of marijuana being labeled as criminals.&quot;
    
</p>

<p>
    However, these legislators were unable to pass a bill that would recriminalize marijuana, but the status of marijuana as a harmful drug was still being debated.
</p>

<p>
    The following two years, in both 1990 and 1991, separate articles were published over the recriminalization of marijuana happening in Alaska, one of which stated, &quot;Oregon may be the next state to feel an assault on its image.&quot;
</p>
<p>
    
The article also asserts, &quot;We dislike laws imposing jail for conduct that harms no one but the user. However, tougher fines and other sanctions might be imposed to discourage the use of marijuana and to let our young people and the rest of the nation know where Oregon stands on drugs.&quot;

</p>

<p>
    
    Then, in 1995, an editorial was published that claimed that the previous legislatures failed to recriminalize marijuana because lawmakers saw so little harm in marijuana. They were ignoring the increased potency it had acquired since the 60s and 70s. The editorialist argued that the state can&apos;t expect young people to believe their message about the danger of drugs if it continues to treat possession as a minor fine. 

</p>

<p>
    In 1997, a news article reported about a study that found that teen drug use had been increasing in the 1990s. It not only found that the number of 11-12 year olds who had friends who use marijuana rose from 7% in 1993 to 13% in 1996 but that children were less likely to believe &quot;people on drugs are stupid,&quot; with 71% in 1995 vs. 65% in 1996.


</p>

<p>
    That same year, the <i>Statesman Journal</i> reported that, &quot;In a move aimed at fighting crime, Oregon lawmakers Tuesday voted to increase penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana.&quot; The articles claimed the move &quot;is one more variable in the equation to mitigate crime in this state.&quot; Proponents of the bill assert that it would send a “get tough” message to pot smokers, especially young ones.
</p>

<p>
    In the same issue, an article stated that sponsors of the bill thought it was Important for the  state to change course and make clear that marijuana is a harmful drug. The same article cited that opponents of it said that the bill&apos;s sponsors had offered no proof that decriminalizing marijuana would reduce its use, especially among young people. A representative was quoted saying, &quot;It creates a new class of criminals. We will have more criminals, but we will have done nothing for the people of Oregon.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    In an issue published 7 days later, the newspaper interviewed a legislator that voted against recriminalization. She believed that If Oregon was serious about sending messages to kids about drugs being harmful then the message should be you have a problem and we can help you. She believed the Message should not be we’re going to put you in jail for 30 days, take your license away, and fine you.
</p>

<p>
    
    Then, on June 9 of the same year, an article appearing in The Albany Democratic Herald quoted a lawmaker calling the decriminalization of 1973 a &quot;failed experiment.&quot; It also claimed that opponents of the recriminalization bill claimed that putting people in jail won’t help the drug problem. They are quoted as saying, &quot;People should pay for crimes, but we’re telling people you have no chance to rehabilitate yourself, no chance to become a productive member of the community.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    
An editorial published in the <i>Corvallis Gazette</i> Times on August 12, 1997, was strongly against the move to recriminalize marijuana. The author claimed that it would: increase violent crime, especially for those under 18, increase availability of marijuana and more dangerous drugs for those under 18, Increase tax burden on lower levels of governmental services for all, and Increase crowding of prison, which would result in early releases of dangerous felons.
</p>

<p>
    In a <i>Statesman Journal</i> article dated Novemeber 4, 1998, it was reported that Voters overwhelmingly overturned Oregon legislators&apos; move to recriminalize small amounts of marijuana from a margin of 2-1. 
    
</p>

<p>
    An editorial published in <i>The World</i> in 2008 called for the legalization of all drugs with the claim that the harms that legal drugs cause will be significantly less than the harm that the black market’s drugs would cause. 
    
</p>

<p>
    Then, in an article published in 2010, the same writer called for the legalization of marijuana in order to stop the war on drugs, citing that similar to how prohibition created Al Capone and the mafia, drugs fund gangs and terrorism. Moreover, the war on drugs has led to the incarceration of nonviolent drug users, which does nothing to help them. 
</p>

<p>
    
    
A writer makes the same claim in an editorial appearing in 2014 with the title, &quot;Fight Heroin with Pot.&quot;

</p>

<h2>
    Conclusion: 
</h2>

<p>
    Unfortunately, the analysis of 34 different newspaper articles did not bring a definitive answer to the question, why is Oregon on the cutting edge of resisting the war on drugs. Regardless, there were several important takeaways. First, in the late 60s and early 70s was a time when the social facts around marijuana were that it was a drug that was more harmful than alcohol, and institutions like the AMA, USDA, and the Health, Education and Welfare Department were coerced into say so. Second, sociologically, it was interesting that the four part series that characterized drugs as incredibly harmful and attempted to educate readers about drugs through anxiety and fear was published a year before Oregon became one of the first states to decriminalize marijuana. Third, the decriminalization of marijuana in 1973 did not lead to an increase in use of the drug. This finding suggests that the criminality of marijuana does not impact use is a social fact. Fourth, the social facts around marijuana changed in the late 80s and 90s, and the previous social facts around criminality and use evaporated. As the number of drug users in Oregon increased, politicians started claiming &quot;tough on crime&quot; was the solution. However, this stance was emphatically rejected by voters in 1998 when legislators attempted to recriminalize marijuana. </p>

<p>Future research should look into the large number of Californians who migrated to Oregon in the 60s and 70s for why Oregon has been so progressive in terms of its resistance to the war on drugs.
